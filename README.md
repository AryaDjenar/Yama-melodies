# Yamamelodies

This project is an interactive map showcasing the unique departure jingles of each station along Tokyo's Yamanote Line. Each station on this circular rail line has a distinctive melody, creating a fun and memorable soundscape for travelers. This map is designed to bring these jingles to life, inviting you to explore Tokyo's stations virtually, inspire future visits, and serve as a creative design practice.

### Inspiration

This project was inspired by my fascination with the musical atmosphere of Tokyo’s railways, and I drew inspiration from existing web projects, particularly:
- [Yamanotes](https://yamanot.es/) – a web-based music box for the Yamanote Line’s jingles.
- [Yamanote.style](http://yamanote.style/) – another beautiful visualization of the Yamanote Line.

Some resources, files, and ideas were adapted from these projects' GitHub repositories to help bring this interactive map to life.
